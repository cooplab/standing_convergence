        <bib-extract role="abstract">Competition between independently arising beneficial
mutations is enhanced in spatial populations due to the
linear rather than exponential growth of clones. Recent
theoretical studies have pointed out that the resulting
fitness dynamics is analogous to a surface growth
process, where new layers nucleate and spread
stochastically, leading to the build up of
scale-invariant roughness. This scenario differs
qualitatively from the standard view of adaptation in
that the speed of adaptation becomes independent of
population size while the fitness variance does not.
Here we exploit recent progress in the understanding of
surface growth processes to obtain precise predictions
for the universal, non-Gaussian shape of the fitness
distribution for one-dimensional habitats, which are
verified by simulations. When the mutations are
deleterious rather than beneficial the problem becomes
a spatial version of Muller’s ratchet. In contrast to
the case of well-mixed populations, the rate of fitness
decline remains finite even in the limit of an infinite
habitat, provided the ratio [Formula: see text] between
the deleterious mutation rate and the square of the
(negative) selection coefficient is sufficiently large.
Using, again, an analogy to surface growth models we
show that the transition between the stationary and the
moving state of the ratchet is governed by directed
percolation.</bib-extract>

        <bib-extract role="abstract">Our knowledge of the genetic basis of normal
pigmentation variation in human populations is quite
incomplete. Recent studies have identified some of the
genes responsible for the reduction in melanin content
in European populations, but this is not the case for
other population groups, such as East Asians. Here, we
report that a genetic variant located within the gene
¡italic¿OCA2¡/italic¿ (rs1800414) is associated with
skin pigmentation in two samples of East Asian
ancestry. The allele associated with lower melanin

                 pigmentation variation in human populations is quite
                 incomplete. Recent studies have identified some of the
                 genes responsible for the reduction in melanin content
                 in European populations, but this is not the case for
                 other population groups, such as East Asians. Here, we
                 report that a genetic variant located within the gene
                 &lt;italic&gt;OCA2&lt;/italic&gt; (rs1800414) is associated with
                 skin pigmentation in two samples of East Asian
                 ancestry. The allele associated with lower melanin
                 levels is found at high frequencies in East Asian

        <bib-data role="description">The role of geography in human adaptation. [PLoS
                 Genet. 2009] - PubMed result</bib-data>
        <bib-extract role="abstract">Various observations argue for a role of adaptation in
recent human evolution, including results from
genome-wide studies and analyses of selection signals
at candidate genes. Here, we use genome-wide SNP data
from the HapMap and CEPH-Human Genome Diversity Panel
samples to study the geographic distributions of
putatively selected alleles at a range of geographic
scales. We find that the average allele frequency
divergence is highly predictive of the most extreme
F(ST) values across the whole genome. On a broad scale,
the geographic distribution of putatively selected
alleles almost invariably conforms to population
clusters identified using randomly chosen genetic
markers. Given this structure, there are surprisingly
few fixed or nearly fixed differences between human
populations. Among the nearly fixed differences that do
exist, nearly all are due to fixation events that
occurred outside of Africa, and most appear in East
Asia. These patterns suggest that selection is often
weak enough that neutral processes – especially
population history, migration, and drift – exert
powerful influences over the fate and geographic
distribution of selected alleles.</bib-extract>

  abstract = {Various observations argue for a role of adaptation in
                 recent human evolution, including results from
                 genome-wide studies and analyses of selection signals
                 at candidate genes. Here, we use genome-wide SNP data
                 from the HapMap and CEPH-Human Genome Diversity Panel
                 samples to study the geographic distributions of
                 putatively selected alleles at a range of geographic
                 scales. We find that the average allele frequency
                 divergence is highly predictive of the most extreme
                 F(ST) values across the whole genome. On a broad scale,
                 the geographic distribution of putatively selected
                 alleles almost invariably conforms to population
                 clusters identified using randomly chosen genetic
                 markers. Given this structure, there are surprisingly
                 few fixed or nearly fixed differences between human
                 populations. Among the nearly fixed differences that do
                 exist, nearly all are due to fixation events that
                 occurred outside of Africa, and most appear in East
                 Asia. These patterns suggest that selection is often
                 weak enough that neutral processes – especially
                 population history, migration, and drift – exert
                 powerful influences over the fate and geographic
                 distribution of selected alleles.},

years ago, anatomically modern humans have quickly
occupied extremely diverse environments. Human
populations were exposed to further environmental
changes resulting from cultural innovations, such as
the spread of farming, which gave rise to new selective
pressures related to pathogen exposures and dietary
shifts. In addition to changing the frequency of
individual adaptive alleles, natural selection may also
shape the overall genetic architecture of adaptive
traits. Here, we review recent advances in
understanding the genetic architecture of adaptive
human phenotypes based on insights from the studies of
lactase persistence, skin pigmentation and
high-altitude adaptation. These adaptations evolved in
parallel in multiple human populations, providing a
chance to investigate independent realizations of the
evolutionary process. We suggest that the outcome of
adaptive evolution is often highly variable even under
similar selective pressures. Finally, we highlight a

        <bib-extract role="abstract">Pigmentation is a polygenic trait encompassing some of
the most visible phenotypic variation observed in
humans. Here we present direct estimates of selection
acting on functional alleles in three key genes known
to be involved in human pigmentation pathwaysâHERC2,
SLC45A2, and TYRâusing allele frequency estimates
from Eneolithic, Bronze Age, and modern Eastern
European samples and forward simulations. Neutrality
was overwhelmingly rejected for all alleles studied,
with point estimates of selection ranging from around
2-10evidence that strong selection favoring lighter skin,
hair, and eye pigmentation has been operating in
European populations over the last 5,000 y.</bib-extract>

                 the most visible phenotypic variation observed in
                 humans. Here we present direct estimates of selection
                 acting on functional alleles in three key genes known
                 to be involved in human pigmentation pathways—HERC2,
                 SLC45A2, and TYR—using allele frequency estimates
                 from Eneolithic, Bronze Age, and modern Eastern
                 European samples and forward simulations. Neutrality
                 was overwhelmingly rejected for all alleles studied,
                 with point estimates of selection ranging from around
                 2-10% per generation. Our results provide direct
                 evidence that strong selection favoring lighter skin,
                 hair, and eye pigmentation has been operating in
                 European populations over the last 5,000 y.},

the accumulation of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities

dependence of the maximum gene-flow rate on ecological
factors (exogeneous selection), genetic factors

show the following: (1) The maximum rate of gene flow
is limited by exogeneous selection. In particular,
maintenance of neutral DMIs is impossible with gene
flow. (2) There are two distinct mechanisms that drive
DMI evolution in parapatry, selection against
immigrants in a heterogeneous environment and selection
against hybrids due to the incompatibility. (3)
Depending on the mechanism, opposite predictions result
concerning the genetic architecture that maximizes the
rate of gene flow a DMI can sustain. Selection against
immigrants favors evolution of tightly linked DMIs of
arbitrary strength, whereas selection against hybrids
promotes the evolution of strong unlinked DMIs. In
diploids, the fitness of the double heterozygotes is
the decisive factor to predict the pattern of DMI
stability.</bib-extract>

extreme value theory, is independent of most biological

                 extreme value theory, is independent of most biological
                 details, including the length of the gene in question
                 and the precise distribution of fitness effects among
                 alleles. I conclude that the probability of parallel
                 evolution under natural selection is nearly twice as
                 large as that under neutrality.},

        <bib-extract role="abstract">The Darwinian explanation for evolution is that it is
the outcome of the interaction between genetic
variation and natural selection. There is now good
evidence for both the existence of genetic variation
and the occurrence of natural selection, the latter
potentially at high intensities. The outcome should be
rapid evolutionary change; yet in practice very little
change is found. Most species are very stable, and in
situations where evolution is observed in one species
often none is found in others despite equivalent
opportunity. Evolutionary failure is commonplace.
Despite the occurrence of high levels of protein
polymorphism, there is good evidence that the supply of
variation making a major contribution to fitness is
very limited. As a result it is argued that lack of
evolution in most species may be due more to lack of
appropriate variability than to other causes: a
condition for which the term ‘genostasis’ is proposed.
In those situations where appropriate genetic variation
is available for one reason or another, evolution is
found to be very rapid. There are good theoretical and
practical reasons for more attention being paid to the
mechanisms of supply of new variation and to those
situations where evolution appears not to be taking
place.</bib-extract>

        <bib-extract role="abstract">Adaptation from de novo mutation can produce so-called
soft selective sweeps, where adaptive alleles of
independent mutational origin sweep through the
population at the same time. Population genetic theory
predicts that such soft sweeps should be likely if the
product of the population size and the mutation rate
toward the adaptive allele is sufficiently large, such
that multiple adaptive mutations can establish before
one has reached fixation; however, it remains unclear
how demographic processes affect the probability of
observing soft sweeps. Here we extend the theory of
soft selective sweeps to realistic demographic
scenarios that allow for changes in population size
over time. We first show that population bottlenecks
can lead to the removal of all but one adaptive lineage
from an initially soft selective sweep. The parameter
regime under which such ”hardening” of soft
selective sweeps is likely is determined by a simple
heuristic condition. We further develop a generalized
analytical framework, based on an extension of the
coalescent process, for calculating the probability of
soft sweeps under arbitrary demographic scenarios. Two
important limits emerge within this analytical
framework: In the limit where population-size
fluctuations are fast compared to the duration of the
sweep, the likelihood of soft sweeps is determined by
the harmonic mean of the variance effective population
size estimated over the duration of the sweep; in the
opposing slow fluctuation limit, the likelihood of soft
sweeps is determined by the instantaneous variance
effective population size at the onset of the sweep. We
show that as a consequence of this finding the
probability of observing soft sweeps becomes a function
of the strength of selection. Specifically, in species
with sharply fluctuating population size, strong
selection is more likely to produce soft sweeps than
weak selection. Our results highlight the importance of
accurate demographic estimates over short evolutionary
timescales for understanding the population genetics of
adaptation from de novo mutation.</bib-extract>

                 selective sweeps is likely is determined by a simple
                 heuristic condition. We further develop a generalized
                 analytical framework, based on an extension of the
                 coalescent process, for calculating the probability of
                 soft sweeps under arbitrary demographic scenarios. Two
                 important limits emerge within this analytical
                 framework: In the limit where population-size
                 fluctuations are fast compared to the duration of the
                 sweep, the likelihood of soft sweeps is determined by
                 the harmonic mean of the variance effective population
                 size estimated over the duration of the sweep; in the
                 opposing slow fluctuation limit, the likelihood of soft
                 sweeps is determined by the instantaneous variance
                 effective population size at the onset of the sweep. We
                 show that as a consequence of this finding the
                 probability of observing soft sweeps becomes a function
                 of the strength of selection. Specifically, in species
                 with sharply fluctuating population size, strong
                 selection is more likely to produce soft sweeps than
                 weak selection. Our results highlight the importance of
                 accurate demographic estimates over short evolutionary
                 timescales for understanding the population genetics of
                 adaptation from de novo mutation.},

        <bib-extract role="abstract">Substitution processes are of two sorts: origination
processes record the times at which nucleotide
mutations that ultimately fix in the population first
appear, and fixation processes record the times at
which they actually fix. Substitution processes may be
generated by combining models of population
genetics-here the symmetrical-neutral, overdominance,
underdominance, TIM, and SAS-CFF models-with the
infinite-sites, no-recombination model of the gene.
This paper is mainly concerned with a computer
simulation study of these substitution processes. The
rate of substitution is shown to be remarkably
insensitive to the strength of selection for models
with strong balancing selection caused by the
genealogical drift of mutations through alleles held in
the population by selection. The origination process is
shown to be more regular than Poisson for the
overdominance, TIM, and SAS-CFF models but more
clustered for the underdominance model. A class of
point processes called Sawyer processes is introduced
to help explain these observations as well as the
observation that the times between successive
originations are nearly uncorrelated. Fixation
processes are shown to be more complex than origination
processes, with regularly spaced bursts of multiple
fixations. An approximation to the fixation process is
described. One important conclusion is that protein
evolution is not easily reconciled with any of these
models without adding perturbations that recur on a
time scale that is commensurate with that of molecular
evolution.</bib-extract>

        <bib-extract role="abstract">The haemoglobinopathies are the commonest single-gene
disorders known, almost certainly because of the
protection they provide against malaria, as attested by
a number of observations. The geographical
distributions of malaria and haemoglobinopathies
largely overlap, and microepidemiological surveys
confirm the close relationship between them. For two of
the commonest disorders, haemoglobin S and
alpha(+)-thalassaemia, there is also good clinical
evidence for protection against malaria morbidity.
However, not all the evidence appears to support this
view. In some parts of the world malaria and
haemoglobinopathies are not, and never have been,
coexistent. It is also difficult to explain why the
majority of haemoglobinopathies appear to be recent
mutations and are regionally specific. Here we argue
that these apparent inconsistencies in the malaria
hypothesis are the result of processes such as genetic
drift and migration and of demographic changes that
have occurred during the past 10,000 years. When these
factors are taken into account, selection by malaria
remains the force responsible for the prevalence of the
haemoglobinopathies.</bib-extract>

                 have occurred during the past 10,000 years. When these

Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) phenomenological

experimentalists keep using the model in its original
form, owing to its simplicity, at times risking to
overinterpret the experimental results. The early
attempts to apply the JMAK model to surface science
date back to the 70’s, but it has been systematically
applied only in the last few years. There is not enough

        <bib-extract role="abstract">There is a growing appreciation among evolutionary
biologists that the rate and tempo of molecular
evolution might often be altered at or near the time of
speciation, i.e. that speciation is in some way a
special time for genes. Molecular phylogenies
frequently reveal increased rates of genetic evolution
associated with speciation and other lines of
investigation suggest that various types of abrupt
genomic disruption can play an important role in
promoting speciation via reproductive isolation. These
phenomena are in conflict with the gradual view of
molecular evolution that is implicit in much of our
thinking about speciation and in the tools of modern
biology. This raises the prospect of studying the
molecular evolutionary consequences of speciation per
se and studying the footprint of speciation as an
active force in promoting genetic divergence. Here we
discuss the reasons to believe that speciation can play
such a role and elaborate on possible mechanisms for
accelerated rates of evolution following speciation. We
provide an example of how it is possible detect whether
accelerated bursts of evolution occur in neutral and/or
adaptive regions of genes and discuss the implications
of rapid episodes of change for conventional models of
molecular evolution. Speciation might often owe more to
ephemeral and essentially arbitrary events that cause
reproductive isolation than to the gradual and regular
tug of natural selection that draws a species into a
new niche.</bib-extract>

        <bib-extract role="abstract">The species concept is a central tenet of biological
diversity. Attempts to describe diversity have led to
empirical concepts of species based on assumptions
found wanting for plants. Plant species lack reality,
cohesion, independence, and simple evolutionary or
ecological roles. The concept of species for plant
taxonomists and evolutionists can only serve as a tool
for characterizing diversity in a mentally satisfying
way. Diversity is idiosyncratic. It is impossible to
reconcile idiosyncrasy with preconceived ideas of
diversity. The search for hidden likenesses is unlikely
to yield a unifying species concept. The concept that
is most operational and utilitarian for plants is a
mental abstraction which orders clusters of diversity
in multidimensional character space.</bib-extract>

        <bib-extract role="abstract">When a mutation with selective advantage s spreads
through a panmictic population, it may cause two
lineages at a linked locus to coalesce; the probability
of coalescence is exp ( â 2 r T ) , where T â¼ log (
2 N s ) / s is the time to fixation, N is the number of
haploid individuals, and r is the recombination rate.
Population structure delays fixation, and so weakens
the effect of a selective sweep. However, favourable
alleles spread through a spatially continuous
population behind a narrow wavefront; ancestral
lineages are confined at the tip of this front, and so
coalesce rapidly. In extremely dense populations,
coalescence is dominated by rare fluctuations ahead of
the front. However, we show that for moderate
densities, a simple quasi-deterministic approximation
applies: the rate of coalescence within the front is Î»
â¼ 2 g ( Î· ) / ( Ï â ) , where Ï is the
population density and â = Ï 2 / s is the
characteristic scale of the wavefront; g ( Î· ) depends
only on the strength of random drift, Î· = Ï Ï s / 2
. The net effect of a sweep on coalescence also depends
crucially on whether two lineages are ever both within
the wavefront at the same time: even in the extreme
case when coalescence within the front is
instantaneous, the net rate of coalescence may be lower
than in a single panmictic population. Sweeps can also
have a substantial impact on the rate of gene flow. A
single lineage will jump to a new location when it is
hit by a sweep, with mean square displacement Ï eff 2
/ Ï 2 = ( 8 / 3 ) ( L / â ) ( Î / R ) ; this can be
substantial if the speciesâ range, L , is large, even
if the species-wide rate of sweeps per map length, Î /
R , is small. This effect is half as strong in two
dimensions. In contrast, the rate of coalescence
between lineages, at random locations in space and on
the genetic map, is proportional to ( c / L ) ( Î / R
) , where c is the wavespeed: thus, on average,
one-dimensional structure is likely to reduce
coalescence due to sweeps, relative to panmixis. In two
dimensions, genes must move along the front before they
can coalesce; this process is rapid, being dominated by
rare fluctuations. This leads to a dramatically higher
rate of coalescence within the wavefront than if
lineages simply diffused along the front. Nevertheless,
the net rate of coalescence due to a sweep through a
two-dimensional population is likely to be lower than
it would be with panmixis.</bib-extract>

        <bib-extract role="abstract">This paper investigates the dynamic behaviour of
hybrid zones which are maintained by a balance between
dispersal and selection against hybrids. In the first
section it is shown that a hybrid zone involving a
single locus can move in response to a selective
imbalance between the two homozygotes, and also to
variation in population density and dispersal rate. It
can be trapped by natural barriers, and so an allele
which is selected against when rare cannot advance,
even if it is advantageous when common. The continuous
model used in deriving these results is shown to be a
good approximation to the stepping-stone model,
provided that the cline contains several demes. The
effect of stochastic forces on multi-locus hybrid zones
is then considered. An expression giving the shift in
position after an arbitrary perturbation in gamete
frequency is derived. Using this formula, it is found
that sampling drift is negligible unless the zone
includes few organisms and involves few loci. Random
variations in population structure are the dominant
force, and could allow considerable movement in an even
environment. However, natural barriers can still trap
hybrid zones, and so it is likely that they will remain
roughly where they first formed.</bib-extract>

        <bib-extract role="abstract">A population can adapt to a rapid environmental change
or habitat expansion in two ways. It may adapt either
through new beneficial mutations that subsequently
sweep through the population or by using alleles from
the standing genetic variation. We use diffusion theory
to calculate the probabilities for selective
adaptations and find a large increase in the fixation
probability for weak substitutions, if alleles
originate from the standing genetic variation. We then
determine the parameter regions where each
scenario-standing variation vs. new mutations-is more
likely. Adaptations from the standing genetic variation
are favored if either the selective advantage is weak
or the selection coefficient and the mutation rate are
both high. Finally, we analyze the probability of
”soft sweeps,” where multiple copies of the
selected allele contribute to a substitution, and
discuss the consequences for the footprint of selection
on linked neutral variation. We find that soft sweeps
with weaker selective footprints are likely under both
scenarios if the mutation rate and/or the selection
coefficient is high.</bib-extract>

  abstract = {A population can adapt to a rapid environmental change
                 or habitat expansion in two ways. It may adapt either
                 through new beneficial mutations that subsequently
                 sweep through the population or by using alleles from
                 the standing genetic variation. We use diffusion theory
                 to calculate the probabilities for selective
                 adaptations and find a large increase in the fixation
                 probability for weak substitutions, if alleles
                 originate from the standing genetic variation. We then
                 determine the parameter regions where each
                 scenario-standing variation vs. new mutations-is more
                 likely. Adaptations from the standing genetic variation
                 are favored if either the selective advantage is weak
                 or the selection coefficient and the mutation rate are
                 both high. Finally, we analyze the probability of
                 {"}soft sweeps,{"} where multiple copies of the
                 selected allele contribute to a substitution, and
                 discuss the consequences for the footprint of selection
                 on linked neutral variation. We find that soft sweeps
                 with weaker selective footprints are likely under both
                 scenarios if the mutation rate and/or the selection
                 coefficient is high.}}

        <bib-extract role="abstract">Models for detecting the effect of adaptation on
population genomic diversity are often predicated on a
single newly arisen mutation sweeping rapidly to
fixation. However, a population can also adapt to a new
environment by multiple mutations of similar phenotypic
effect that arise in parallel, at the same locus or
different loci. These mutations can each quickly reach
intermediate frequency, preventing any single one from
rapidly sweeping to fixation globally, leading to a
”soft” sweep in the population. Here we study
various models of parallel mutation in a continuous,
geographically spread population adapting to a global
selection pressure. The slow geographic spread of a
selected allele due to limited dispersal can allow
other selected alleles to arise and start to spread
elsewhere in the species range. When these different
selected alleles meet, their spread can slow
dramatically and so initially form a geographic
patchwork, a random tessellation, which could be
mistaken for a signal of local adaptation. This spatial
tessellation will dissipate over time due to mixing by
migration, leaving a set of partial sweeps within the
global population. We show that the spatial
tessellation initially formed by mutational types is
closely connected to Poisson process models of
crystallization, which we extend. We find that the
probability of parallel mutation and the spatial scale
on which parallel mutation occurs are captured by a
single compound parameter, a characteristic length,
which reflects the expected distance a spreading allele
travels before it encounters a different spreading
allele. This characteristic length depends on the
mutation rate, the dispersal parameter, the effective
local density of individuals, and to a much lesser
extent the strength of selection. While our knowledge
of these parameters is poor, we argue that even in
widely dispersing species, such parallel geographic
sweeps may be surprisingly common. Thus, we predict
that as more data become available, many more examples
of intraspecies parallel adaptation will be
uncovered.</bib-extract>

  abstract = {Models for detecting the effect of adaptation on
                 population genomic diversity are often predicated on a
                 single newly arisen mutation sweeping rapidly to
                 fixation. However, a population can also adapt to a new
                 environment by multiple mutations of similar phenotypic
                 effect that arise in parallel, at the same locus or
                 different loci. These mutations can each quickly reach
                 intermediate frequency, preventing any single one from
                 rapidly sweeping to fixation globally, leading to a
                 {"}soft{"} sweep in the population. Here we study
                 various models of parallel mutation in a continuous,
                 geographically spread population adapting to a global
                 selection pressure. The slow geographic spread of a
                 selected allele due to limited dispersal can allow
                 other selected alleles to arise and start to spread
                 elsewhere in the species range. When these different
                 selected alleles meet, their spread can slow
                 dramatically and so initially form a geographic
                 patchwork, a random tessellation, which could be
                 mistaken for a signal of local adaptation. This spatial
                 tessellation will dissipate over time due to mixing by
                 migration, leaving a set of partial sweeps within the
                 global population. We show that the spatial
                 tessellation initially formed by mutational types is
                 closely connected to Poisson process models of
                 crystallization, which we extend. We find that the
                 probability of parallel mutation and the spatial scale
                 on which parallel mutation occurs are captured by a
                 single compound parameter, a characteristic length,
                 which reflects the expected distance a spreading allele
                 travels before it encounters a different spreading
                 allele. This characteristic length depends on the
                 mutation rate, the dispersal parameter, the effective
                 local density of individuals, and to a much lesser
                 extent the strength of selection. While our knowledge
                 of these parameters is poor, we argue that even in
                 widely dispersing species, such parallel geographic
                 sweeps may be surprisingly common. Thus, we predict
                 that as more data become available, many more examples
                 of intraspecies parallel adaptation will be
                 uncovered.},

        <bib-title>Different genes underlie adaptive melanism in different populations of rock pocket mice</bib-title>
        <bib-extract role="abstract">Identifying the genes responsible for adaptation has
been an elusive goal in evolutionary biology. Rock
pocket mice (Chaetodipus intermedius) provide a useful
system for studying the genetics of adaptation: most C.
intermedius are light-coloured and live on
light-coloured rocks, but in several different
geographical regions, C. intermedius are melanic and
live on dark-coloured basalt lava, presumably as an
adaptation for crypsis. Previous work demonstrated that
mutations at the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (Mc1r)
are responsible for the dark/light difference in mice
from one population in Arizona. Here, we investigate
whether melanism has evolved independently in
populations of dark C. intermedius from New Mexico, and
whether the same or different genes underlie the dark
phenotype in mice from these populations compared with
the dark mice from Arizona. Seventy-six mice were
collected from pairs of dark and light localities
representing four different lava flows and adjacent
light-coloured rocks; lava flows were separated by
70-750 km. Spectrophotometric analysis of mouse pelage
and of rock samples revealed a strong positive
association between coat colour and substrate colour.
No significant differences were observed in the colour
of rocks among the four lava flows, suggesting that
mice in these separate populations have experienced
similar selection for crypsis. Despite this similarity
in environment, melanic mice from the three New Mexico
populations were slightly, but significantly, darker
than melanic mice from Arizona. The entire Mc1r gene
was sequenced in all mice. The previously identified
mutations responsible for the light/dark difference in
mice from Arizona were absent in all melanic mice from
three different populations in New Mexico. Five new
Mc1r polymorphisms were observed among mice from New
Mexico, but none showed any association with coat
colour. These results indicate that adaptive melanism
has arisen at least twice in C. intermedius and that
these similar phenotypic changes have a different
genetic basis.</bib-extract>

despite phenotypic similarities, the derived Mc1r

single amino acid mutations segregating in Atlantic

        <bib-extract role="abstract">Identifying the molecular basis of phenotypes that
have evolved independently can provide insight into the
ways genetic and developmental constraints influence
the maintenance of phenotypic diversity. Melanic
(darkly pigmented) phenotypes in mammals provide a
potent system in which to study the genetic basis of
naturally occurring mutant phenotypes because melanism
occurs in many mammals, and the mammalian pigmentation
pathway is well understood. Spontaneous alleles of a
few key pigmentation loci are known to cause melanism
in domestic or laboratory populations of mammals, but
in natural populations, mutations at one gene, the
melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r), have been implicated in
the vast majority of cases, possibly due to its minimal
pleiotropic effects. To investigate whether mutations
in this or other genes cause melanism in the wild, we
investigated the genetic basis of melanism in the
rodent genus Peromyscus, in which melanic mice have
been reported in several populations. We focused on two
genes known to cause melanism in other taxa, Mc1r and
its antagonist, the agouti signaling protein (Agouti).
While variation in the Mc1r coding region does not
correlate with melanism in any population, in a New
Hampshire population, we find that a 125-kb deletion,
which includes the upstream regulatory region and exons
1 and 2 of Agouti, results in a loss of Agouti
expression and is perfectly associated with melanic
color. In a second population from Alaska, we find that
a premature stop codon in exon 3 of Agouti is
associated with a similar melanic phenotype. These
results show that melanism has evolved independently in
these populations through mutations in the same gene,
and suggest that melanism produced by mutations in
genes other than Mc1r may be more common than
previously thought.</bib-extract>

                 (darkly pigmented) phenotypes in mammals provide a
                 potent system in which to study the genetic basis of
                 naturally occurring mutant phenotypes because melanism
                 occurs in many mammals, and the mammalian pigmentation
                 pathway is well understood. Spontaneous alleles of a
                 few key pigmentation loci are known to cause melanism
                 in domestic or laboratory populations of mammals, but
                 in natural populations, mutations at one gene, the
                 melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r), have been implicated in
                 the vast majority of cases, possibly due to its minimal
                 pleiotropic effects. To investigate whether mutations
                 in this or other genes cause melanism in the wild, we
                 investigated the genetic basis of melanism in the
                 rodent genus Peromyscus, in which melanic mice have
                 been reported in several populations. We focused on two
                 genes known to cause melanism in other taxa, Mc1r and
                 its antagonist, the agouti signaling protein (Agouti).
                 While variation in the Mc1r coding region does not
                 correlate with melanism in any population, in a New
                 Hampshire population, we find that a 125-kb deletion,
                 which includes the upstream regulatory region and exons
                 1 and 2 of Agouti, results in a loss of Agouti
                 expression and is perfectly associated with melanic
                 color. In a second population from Alaska, we find that
                 a premature stop codon in exon 3 of Agouti is
                 associated with a similar melanic phenotype. These
                 results show that melanism has evolved independently in
                 these populations through mutations in the same gene,
                 and suggest that melanism produced by mutations in
                 genes other than Mc1r may be more common than
                 previously thought.},

        <bib-extract role="abstract">The population-genetic consequences of population
structure are of great interest and have been studied
extensively. An area of particular interest is the
interaction among population structure, natural
selection, and genetic drift. At first glance,
different results in this area give very different
impressions of the effect of population subdivision on
effective population size (N(e)), suggesting that no
single value of N(e) can completely characterize a
structured population. Results presented here show that
a population conforming to Wright’s island model of
subdivision with genic selection can be related to an
idealized panmictic population (a Wright-Fisher
population). This equivalent panmictic population has a
larger size than the actual population; i.e., N(e) is
larger than the actual population size, as expected
from many results for this type of population
structure. The selection coefficient in the equivalent
panmictic population, referred to here as the effective
selection coefficient (s(e)), is smaller than the
actual selection coefficient (s). This explains how the
fixation probability of a selected allele can be
unaffected by population subdivision despite the fact
that subdivision increases N(e), for the product
N(e)s(e) is not altered by subdivision.</bib-extract>

  abstract = {The population-genetic consequences of population
                 structure are of great interest and have been studied
                 extensively. An area of particular interest is the
                 interaction among population structure, natural
                 selection, and genetic drift. At first glance,
                 different results in this area give very different
                 impressions of the effect of population subdivision on
                 effective population size (N(e)), suggesting that no
                 single value of N(e) can completely characterize a
                 structured population. Results presented here show that
                 a population conforming to Wright's island model of
                 subdivision with genic selection can be related to an
                 idealized panmictic population (a Wright-Fisher
                 population). This equivalent panmictic population has a
                 larger size than the actual population; i.e., N(e) is
                 larger than the actual population size, as expected
                 from many results for this type of population
                 structure. The selection coefficient in the equivalent
                 panmictic population, referred to here as the effective
                 selection coefficient (s(e)), is smaller than the
                 actual selection coefficient (s). This explains how the
                 fixation probability of a selected allele can be
                 unaffected by population subdivision despite the fact
                 that subdivision increases N(e), for the product
                 N(e)s(e) is not altered by subdivision.},

        <bib-extract role="abstract">New factors arise in a species by the process of
mutation. The frequency of mutation is generally small,
but it seems probable that it can sometimes be
increased by changes in the environment (1,2). On the
whole mutants recessive to the normal type occur more
commonly than dominants. The frequency of a given type
of mutation varies, but for some factors in Drosophila
it must be less than 10â6, and is much less in some
human cases. We shall first consider initial
conditions, when only a few of the new type exist as
the result of a single mutation; and then the course of
events in a population where the new factor is present
in such numbers as to be in no danger of extinction by
mere bad luck. In the first section the treatment of
Fisher (3) is followed.</bib-extract>

        <bib-extract role="abstract">Call a random partition of the positive
integerspartially exchangeable if for each finite
sequence of positive integersn 1,…,n k, the
probability that the partition breaks the firstn
1+…+nk integers intok particular classes, of sizesn
1,…,nk in order of their first elements, has the same
valuep(n 1,…,nk) for every possible choice of classes
subject to the sizes constraint. A random partition is
exchangeable iff it is partially exchangeable for a
symmetric functionp(n 1,…nk). A representation is
given for partially exchangeable random partitions
which provides a useful variation of Kingman’s
representation in the exchangeable case. Results are
illustrated by the two-parameter generalization of
Ewens’ partition structure.</bib-extract>

                 integerspartially exchangeable if for each finite
                 sequence of positive integersn 1,…,n k, the
                 probability that the partition breaks the firstn

                 valuep(n 1,…,nk) for every possible choice of classes
                 subject to the sizes constraint. A random partition is
                 exchangeable iff it is partially exchangeable for a
                 symmetric functionp(n 1,…nk). A representation is
                 given for partially exchangeable random partitions
                 which provides a useful variation of Kingman's
                 representation in the exchangeable case. Results are
                 illustrated by the two-parameter generalization of
                 Ewens' partition structure.},

        <bib-extract role="abstract">Elucidating the causes of population divergence is a
central goal of evolutionary biology. Rock pocket mice,
Chaeotdipus intermedius, are an ideal system in which
to study intraspecific phenotypic divergence because of
the extensive color variation observed within this
species. Here, we investigate whether phenotypic
variation in color is correlated with local
environmental conditions or with phylogenetic history.
First, we quantified variation in pelage color (n=107
mice) and habitat color (n=51 rocks) using a
spectrophotometer, and showed that there was a
correlation between pelage color and habitat color
across 14 sampled populations (R2=0.43). Analyses of
mtDNA sequences from these same individuals revealed
strong population structure in this species across its
range, where most variation (63%) was partitioned
between five geographic regions. Using Mantel tests, we
show that there is no correlation between color
variation and mtDNA phylogeny, suggesting that pelage
coloration has evolved rapidly. At a finer geographical
scale, high levels of gene flow between neighboring
melanic and light populations suggest the selection
acting on color must be quite strong to maintain
habitat-specific phenotypic distributions. Finally, we
raise the possibility that, in some cases, migration
between populations of pocket mice inhabiting different
lava flows may be responsible for similar melanic
phenotypes in different populations. Together, the
results suggest that color variation can evolve very
rapidly over small geographic scales and that gene flow
can both hinder and promote local adaptation.</bib-extract>

  abstract = {Elucidating the causes of population divergence is a
                 central goal of evolutionary biology. Rock pocket mice,
                 Chaeotdipus intermedius, are an ideal system in which
                 to study intraspecific phenotypic divergence because of
                 the extensive color variation observed within this
                 species. Here, we investigate whether phenotypic
                 variation in color is correlated with local
                 environmental conditions or with phylogenetic history.
                 First, we quantified variation in pelage color (n=107
                 mice) and habitat color (n=51 rocks) using a
                 spectrophotometer, and showed that there was a
                 correlation between pelage color and habitat color
                 across 14 sampled populations (R2=0.43). Analyses of
                 mtDNA sequences from these same individuals revealed
                 strong population structure in this species across its
                 range, where most variation (63\%) was partitioned
                 between five geographic regions. Using Mantel tests, we
                 show that there is no correlation between color
                 variation and mtDNA phylogeny, suggesting that pelage
                 coloration has evolved rapidly. At a finer geographical
                 scale, high levels of gene flow between neighboring
                 melanic and light populations suggest the selection
                 acting on color must be quite strong to maintain
                 habitat-specific phenotypic distributions. Finally, we
                 raise the possibility that, in some cases, migration
                 between populations of pocket mice inhabiting different
                 lava flows may be responsible for similar melanic
                 phenotypes in different populations. Together, the
                 results suggest that color variation can evolve very
                 rapidly over small geographic scales and that gene flow
                 can both hinder and promote local adaptation.},

genotype may provide evidence for natural selection.
Here, we compare phenotypic variation in color, allele
frequencies of a pigmentation gene (the melanocortin-1
receptor, Mc1r), and patterns of neutral mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) variation in rock pocket mice (Chaetodipus
intermedius) across a habitat gradient in southern
Arizona. Pocket mice inhabiting volcanic lava have dark
coats with unbanded, uniformly melanic hairs, whereas
mice from nearby light-colored granitic rocks have
light coats with banded hairs. This color polymorphism
is a presumed adaptation to avoid predation. Previous
work has demonstrated that two Mc1r alleles, D and d,
differ by four amino acids, and are responsible for the
color polymorphism: DD and Dd genotypes are melanic
whereas dd genotypes are light colored. To determine
the frequency of the two Mc1r allelic classes across
the dark-colored lava and neighboring light-colored
granite, we sequenced the Mc1r gene in 175 individuals
from a 35-km transect in the Pinacate lava region. We
also sequenced two neutral mtDNA genes, COIII and ND3,
in the same individuals. We found a strong correlation
between Mc1r allele frequency and habitat color and no
correlation between mtDNA markers and habitat color.
Using estimates of migration from mtDNA haplotypes
between dark- and light-colored sampling sites and Mc1r
allele frequencies at each site, we estimated selection
coefficients against mismatched Mc1r alleles, assuming
a simple model of migration-selection balance.
Habitat-dependent selection appears strong but
asymmetric: selection is stronger against light mice on
dark rock than against melanic mice on light rock.
Together these results suggest that natural selection
acts to match pocket mouse coat color to substrate
color, despite high levels of gene flow between light
and melanic populations.</bib-extract>

        <bib-extract role="abstract">We revisited a classic study of morphological
variation in the oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus)
to estimate the strength of selection acting on
pigmentation patterns and to identify the underlying
genes. We measured 215 specimens collected by Francis
Sumner in the 1920s from eight populations across a
155-km, environmentally variable transect from the
white sands of Florida’s Gulf coast to the dark, loamy
soil of southeastern Alabama. Like Sumner, we found
significant variation among populations: mice
inhabiting coastal sand dunes had larger feet, longer
tails, and lighter pigmentation than inland
populations. Most striking, all seven pigmentation
traits examined showed a sharp decrease in reflectance
about 55 km from the coast, with most of the phenotypic
change occurring over less than 10 km. The largest
change in soil reflectance occurred just south of this
break in pigmentation. Geographic analysis of
microsatellite markers shows little interpopulation
differentiation, so the abrupt change in pigmentation
is not associated with recent secondary contact or
reduced gene flow between adjacent populations. Using
these genetic data, we estimated that the strength of
selection needed to maintain the observed distribution
of pigment traits ranged from 0.0004 to 21%, depending
on the trait and model used. We also examined changes
in allele frequency of SNPs in two pigmentation genes,
Mc1r and Agouti, and show that mutations in the
cis-regulatory region of Agouti may contribute to this
cline in pigmentation. The concordance between
environmental variation and pigmentation in the face of
high levels of interpopulation gene flow strongly
implies that natural selection is maintaining a steep
cline in pigmentation and the genes underlying it.</bib-extract>

                 represents the population density, $d(x,u)$ the
                 (possibly) density dependent diffusion rate, ${\bf
                 b(x)}$ drift, c the limiting effects of crowding, and
                 $m(x)$ the local growth rate of the population. The
                 growth rate $m(x)$ is positive on favorable habitats
                 and negative on unfavorable ones. The environment
                 $\Omega $ is bounded and surrounded by uninhabitable
                 regions, so that $u = 0$ on $\partial \Omega \times

        <bib-extract role="abstract">Numerous insects have independently evolved the
ability to feed on plants that produce toxic secondary
compounds called cardenolides and can sequester these
compounds for use in their defense. We surveyed the
protein target for cardenolides, the alpha subunit of
the sodium pump, Na+,K+-ATPase (ATPÎ±), in 14 species
that feed on cardenolide-producing plants and 15
outgroups spanning three insect orders. Despite the
large number of potential targets for modulating
cardenolide sensitivity, amino acid substitutions
associated with host-plant specialization are highly
clustered, with many parallel substitutions.
Additionally, we document four independent duplications
of ATPÎ± with convergent tissue-specific expression
patterns. We find that unique substitutions are
disproportionately associated with recent duplications
relative to parallel substitutions. Together, these
findings support the hypothesis that adaptation tends
to take evolutionary paths that minimize negative
pleiotropy.</bib-extract>

  abstract = {Numerous insects have independently evolved the
                 ability to feed on plants that produce toxic secondary
                 compounds called cardenolides and can sequester these
                 compounds for use in their defense. We surveyed the
                 protein target for cardenolides, the alpha subunit of
                 the sodium pump, Na+,K+-ATPase (ATPα), in 14 species
                 that feed on cardenolide-producing plants and 15
                 outgroups spanning three insect orders. Despite the
                 large number of potential targets for modulating
                 cardenolide sensitivity, amino acid substitutions
                 associated with host-plant specialization are highly
                 clustered, with many parallel substitutions.
                 Additionally, we document four independent duplications
                 of ATPα with convergent tissue-specific expression
                 patterns. We find that unique substitutions are
                 disproportionately associated with recent duplications
                 relative to parallel substitutions. Together, these
                 findings support the hypothesis that adaptation tends
                 to take evolutionary paths that minimize negative
                 pleiotropy.},

        <bib-extract role="abstract">Most species are superbly and intricately adapted to
the environments in which they live. Adaptive evolution
by natural selection is the primary force shaping
biological diversity. Differences between closely
related species in ecologically selected characters
such as habitat preference, reproductive timing,
courtship behavior, or pollinator attraction may
prevent interbreeding in nature, causing reproductive
isolation. But does ecological adaptation cause
reproductive incompatibilities such as hybrid sterility
or lethality? Although several genes causing hybrid
incompatibilities have been identified, there is
intense debate over whether the genes that contribute
to ecological adaptations also cause hybrid
incompatibilities. Thirty years ago, a genetic study of
local adaptation to copper mine soils in the wildflower
Mimulus guttatus identified a locus that appeared to
cause copper tolerance and hybrid lethality in crosses
to other populations. But do copper tolerance and
hybrid lethality have the same molecular genetic basis?
Here we show, using high-resolution genome mapping,
that copper tolerance and hybrid lethality are not
caused by the same gene but are in fact separately
controlled by two tightly linked loci. We further show
that selection on the copper tolerance locus indirectly
caused the hybrid incompatibility allele to go to high
frequency in the copper mine population because of
hitchhiking. Our results provide a new twist on
Darwin’s original supposition that hybrid
incompatibilities evolve as an incidental by-product of
ordinary adaptation to the environment.</bib-extract>

        <bib-extract role="abstract">There are many striking examples of phenotypic
convergence in nature, in some cases associated with
changes in the same genes. But even mutations in the
same gene may have different biochemical properties and
thus different evolutionary consequences. Here we
dissect the molecular mechanism of convergent evolution
in three lizard species with blanched coloration on the
gypsum dunes of White Sands, New Mexico. These White
Sands forms have rapidly evolved cryptic coloration in
the last few thousand years, presumably to avoid
predation. We use cell-based assays to demonstrate that
independent mutations in the same gene underlie the
convergent blanched phenotypes in two of the three
species. Although the same gene contributes to light
phenotypes in these White Sands populations, the
specific molecular mechanisms leading to reduced
melanin production are different. In one case,
mutations affect receptor signaling and in the other,
the ability of the receptor to integrate into the
melanocyte membrane. These functional differences have
important ramifications at the organismal level.
Derived alleles in the two species show opposite
dominance patterns, which in turn affect their
visibility to selection and the spatial distribution of
alleles across habitats. Our results demonstrate that
even when the same gene is responsible for phenotypic
convergence, differences in molecular mechanism can
have dramatic consequences on trait expression and
ultimately the adaptive trajectory.</bib-extract>

  abstract = {There are many striking examples of phenotypic
                 convergence in nature, in some cases associated with
                 changes in the same genes. But even mutations in the
                 same gene may have different biochemical properties and
                 thus different evolutionary consequences. Here we
                 dissect the molecular mechanism of convergent evolution
                 in three lizard species with blanched coloration on the
                 gypsum dunes of White Sands, New Mexico. These White
                 Sands forms have rapidly evolved cryptic coloration in
                 the last few thousand years, presumably to avoid
                 predation. We use cell-based assays to demonstrate that
                 independent mutations in the same gene underlie the
                 convergent blanched phenotypes in two of the three
                 species. Although the same gene contributes to light
                 phenotypes in these White Sands populations, the
                 specific molecular mechanisms leading to reduced
                 melanin production are different. In one case,
                 mutations affect receptor signaling and in the other,
                 the ability of the receptor to integrate into the
                 melanocyte membrane. These functional differences have
                 important ramifications at the organismal level.
                 Derived alleles in the two species show opposite
                 dominance patterns, which in turn affect their
                 visibility to selection and the spatial distribution of
                 alleles across habitats. Our results demonstrate that
                 even when the same gene is responsible for phenotypic
                 convergence, differences in molecular mechanism can
                 have dramatic consequences on trait expression and
                 ultimately the adaptive trajectory.},

        <bib-extract role="abstract">Large scale genomic surveys are partly motivated by
the idea that the neutral genetic variation of a
population may be used to reconstruct its migration
history. However, our ability to trace back the
colonization pathways of a species from their genetic
footprints is limited by our understanding of the
genetic consequences of a range expansion. Here, we
study, by means of simulations and analytical methods,
the neutral dynamics of gene frequencies in an asexual
population undergoing a continual range expansion in
one dimension. During such a colonization period,
lineages can fix at the wave front by means of a
”surfing” mechanism [Edmonds, C.A., Lillie, A.S.,
Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., 2004. Mutations arising in the
wave front of an expanding population. Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. 101, 975-979]. We quantify this phenomenon
in terms of (i) the spatial distribution of lineages
that reach fixation and, closely related, (ii) the
continual loss of genetic diversity (heterozygosity) at
the wave front, characterizing the approach to
fixation. Our stochastic simulations show that an
effective population size can be assigned to the wave
that controls the (observable) gradient in
heterozygosity left behind the colonization process.
This effective population size is markedly higher in
the presence of cooperation between individuals
(”pushed waves”) than when individuals proliferate
independently (”pulled waves”), and increases only
sub-linearly with deme size. To explain these and other
findings, we develop a versatile analytical approach,
based on the physics of reaction-diffusion systems,
that yields simple predictions for any deterministic
population dynamics. Our analytical theory compares
well with the simulation results for pushed waves, but
is less accurate in the case of pulled waves when
stochastic fluctuations in the tip of the wave are
important.</bib-extract>

                 prediction and understanding does, however, lie in the
                 elucidation of mechanisms underlying the observed
                 patterns. We discuss candidate neurological, olfactory,
                 and learning mechanisms for the emergence of Levy
                 flight patterns in some organisms, and note that
                 convergence of behaviors along such different
                 evolutionary pathways is not surprising given the
                 energetic efficiencies that L\'evy flight movement
                 patterns confer.},

        <bib-extract role="abstract">Gene flow among populations can enhance local
adaptation if it introduces new genetic variants
available for selection, but strong gene flow can also
stall adaptation by swamping locally beneficial genes.
These outcomes can depend on population size, genetic
variation, and the environmental context. Gene flow
patterns may align with geographic distance
(IBDâisolation by distance), whereby immigration
rates are inversely proportional to the distance
between populations. Alternatively gene flow may follow
patterns of isolation by environment (IBE), whereby
gene flow rates are higher among similar environments.
Finally, gene flow may be highest among dissimilar
environments (counter-gradient gene flow), the classic
âgene-swampingâ scenario. Here we survey relevant
studies to determine the prevalence of each pattern
across environmental gradients. Of 70 studies, we found
evidence of IBD in 20.0%, IBE in 37.1%, and both
patterns in 37.1%. In addition, 10.0% of studies
exhibited counter-gradient gene flow. In total, 74.3%
showed significant IBE patterns. This predominant IBE
pattern of gene flow may have arisen directly through
natural selection or reflect other adaptive and
nonadaptive processes leading to nonrandom gene flow.
It also precludes gene swamping as a widespread
phenomenon. Implications for evolutionary processes and
management under rapidly changing environments (e.g.,
climate change) are discussed.</bib-extract>

        <bib-extract role="abstract">In California, soils derived from serpentine rock
support a unique flora, many species of which are
narrowly endemic on this infertile soil type. Previous
soil analyses of serpentine have shown that this soil
is unusually high in magnesium, chromium, and nickel.
Soils derived from this ultra-basic rock are also
markedly deficient in calcium, nitrogen, phosphate, and
occasionally molybdenum. Although chiefly restricted to
serpentine, strains of Streptanthus glandulosus are
occasionally also found on non-serpentine soils. When
grown in experimental cultures, collections of strains
from non-serpentine localities showed a marked
intolerance to serpentine soil, whereas collections of
other strains of the same species from serpentine sites
attained normal growth on serpentine soil. The
distribution pattern and intraspecific differences in
serpentine tolerance of S. glandulosus have suggested
”biotype depletion” as one possible mode of origin
of serpentine endemics. This species is interpreted as
being on the verge of becoming a strict serpentine
endemic once its few non-serpentine biotypes have been
eliminated. Tests for tolerance to serpentine soil were
conducted on species of other genera occurring
naturally on serpentine as well as on non-serpentine
soils (”bodenvag” species). As was shown for
Streptanthus, two of these non-endemic species - Gilia
capitata and Achillea borealis-could be separated into
serpentine-intolerant and serpentine-tolerant races on
the basis of their growth responses on serpentile soil.
From a biosystematic standpoint these soil races can be
thought of as edaphic ecotypes. Yet these particular
physiological differences are often wholly superimposed
upon a single climatic ecotype.</bib-extract>

        <bib-extract role="abstract">This little book continues the sequence of useful
introductory texts on point process themes initiated by
the first author’s monograph on renewal processes
[Renewal theory, Methuen, London, 1962; MR0153061 (27
#3030)] and continued with his and P. A. W. Lewis’
monograph [The statistical analysis of series of
events, Methuen, London, 1966; MR0199942 (33 #8082)].
Similar to its predecessors in its succinct but
informal style, it differs from the first by its much
wider scope, and from the second by its emphasis on the
formulation of special models and the derivation of
their basic properties. A brief introduction to the
general theory is provided, but many important ideas
and techniques are introduced and developed through the
study of particular examples. In this way the reader is
led quickly to the essential ideas in a wide range of
topics, and given a useful perspective on their
applications and directions of further development.
There are six chapters: Introduction; Theoretical
framework; Special models; Operations on point
processes; Multivariate point processes; Spatial
processes. All except the last are concerned with point
processes evolving in time, with the emphasis on
stationary processes. Each chapter is furnished with
exercises giving additional results and examples, and
with bibliographic notes giving references to selected
papers and monographs relevant to the chapter
concerned. The book will perhaps be most useful as an
introduction to the mathematical treatment of point
processes for students of mathematics and statistics at
beginning graduate level or thereabout, and for
research workers in the various applied fields where
point processes are an important theoretical tool. It
lacks a little in depth of treatment both of the
mathematical theory and of particular applications,
while the specialists may regret the omission of
particular themes or examples. In the main, however,
the book is a tribute to the skill and judgement of the
authors in selecting material that outlines a wide
range of ideas in a brief and accessible manner.</bib-extract>

  abstract = {Understanding why some species have more genetic
                 diversity than others is central to the study of
                 ecology and evolution, and carries potentially
                 important implications for conservation biology. Yet
                 not only does this question remain unresolved, it has
                 largely fallen into disregard. With the rapid decrease
                 in sequencing costs, we argue that it is time to revive
                 it.},
