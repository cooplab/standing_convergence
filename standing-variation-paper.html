<p class="ltx_p">The extent to which populations experiencing shared selective pressures
adapt through a shared genetic response
is relevant to many questions in evolutionary biology.
In a number of well studied traits and species,
it appears that convergent evolution within species is common.
In this paper,
we explore how standing, genetic variation contributes to
convergent genetic responses in a geographically spread population,
extending our previous work on the topic.
Geographically limited dispersal slows the spread of each selected allele,
hence allowing other alleles
– newly arisen mutants or present as standing variation –
to spread before any one comes to dominate the population.
When such alleles meet, their progress is substantially slowed
– if the alleles are selectively equivalent,
they mix slowly, dividing the species range into a random tessellation,
which can be well understood by analogy to a Poisson process model of crystallization.
In this framework,
we derive the geographic scale over which a typical allele is expected to dominate,
the time it takes the species to adapt as a whole,
and the proportion of adaptive alleles that arise from standing variation.
Finally, we explore how negative pleiotropic effects of alleles before an environment change
can bias the subset of alleles that contribute to the species’ adaptive response.
We apply the results to the many geographically localized G6PD
deficiency alleles thought to confer resistance to malaria, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#FF0000;">where the large
mutational target size makes it a likely candidate for adaptation
from standing variation, despite the selective cost of G6PD
deficiency alleles in the absence of malaria.</span>
We find the numbers and geographic spread of these alleles matches our predictions reasonably well,
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#FF0000;">consistent with the view that they arose from a combination of</span>
standing variation and new mutations since the advent of malaria.
Our results suggest that much of adaptation may be geographically local
even when selection pressures are homogeneous.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#FF0000;">Therefore, we argue that caution must be exercised when arguing that strongly
geographically restricted alleles are necessarily the outcome of local adaptation.</span>
We close by discussing the implications of these results for
ideas of species coherence and the nature of divergence between species.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">There are an increasing number of examples where
different populations within a species have
adapted to similar environments by means of independent genetic changes.
In some cases this convergent evolution <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#FF0000;">is the result of quite
distinct genetic changes, involving very different genes and pathways,</span> despite shared selection pressures;
in other cases independent adaptations are identical down the same
nucleotide change
<cite class="ltx_cite">(Jeong and Rienzo, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="Adaptations to local environments in modern human populations" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; Stern, <a href="#bib.bib161" title="The genetic causes of convergent evolution" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>; Martin and Orgogozo, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="The Loci of repeated evolution: a catalog of genetic hotspots of phenotypic variation" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>; Conte<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="The probability of genetic parallelism and convergence in natural populations" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>.
Such convergent evolution within populations has been seen for many
carefully studied phenotypes across a range of species,
including drug resistance in pathogens,
resistance to pathogens or pesticides,
and the molecular basis of pigmentation changes.
The phrase “parallel evolution” is also used to refer to such convergent evolution;
here we use these synonymously,
as we are concerned with adaptation within a single
species that can occur via a different or shared genetic routes <cite class="ltx_cite">(see Arendt and Reznick, <a href="#bib.bib101" title="Convergence and parallelism reconsidered: what have we learned about the genetics of adaptation?" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>, for more discussion)</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
      
<p class="ltx_p">The issue of convergent adaptation within species touches on a number
of important questions in evolutionary biology.
These include the extent to which adaptation is shaped by pleiotropic constraints <cite class="ltx_cite">(Haldane, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="The causes of evolution" class="ltx_ref">1932</a>; Orr, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="The probability of parallel evolution" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite>,
whether adaptation is mutation-limited <cite class="ltx_cite">(Bradshaw, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="The Croonian lecture, 1991: Genostasis and the limits to evolution" class="ltx_ref">1991</a>; Karasov<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="Evidence that adaptation in Drosophila is not limited by mutation at single sites" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>,
and to <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#FF0000;">what degree species should be regarded</span> as cohesive units.
Convergent evolution also affects our ability to detect adaptation from population genomic data,
since no single allele sweeps to fixation over the entire area affected by the selection pressure <cite class="ltx_cite">(Pennings and Hermisson, <a href="#bib.bib115" title="Soft sweeps III: the signature of positive selection from recurrent mutation" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>.</p>
    
</div>
    
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
      
<p class="ltx_p">Convergent evolution can occur even within a well mixed population
subject to a constant selection pressure,
either through selection on multiple mutations present as standing variation within the population
before selection pressures switch <cite class="ltx_cite">(Orr and Betancourt, <a href="#bib.bib43" title="Haldane’s sieve and adaptation from the standing genetic variation" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>; Hermisson and Pennings, <a href="#bib.bib116" title="Soft sweeps: molecular population genetics of adaptation from standing genetic variation" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite>,
or due to multiple adaptive alleles that arise after selection pressures switch <cite class="ltx_cite">(Pennings and Hermisson, <a href="#bib.bib117" title="Soft sweeps II - molecular population genetics of adaptation from recurrent mutation or migration" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>.
Previous work has shown that
a primary determinant of the probability that multiple alleles contribute to adaptation
is the product of the population size and the mutation rate <cite class="ltx_cite">(see Messer and Petrov, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="Population genomics of rapid adaptation by soft selective sweeps" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>, for a review)</cite>.</p>
    
</div>
    
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
      
<p class="ltx_p">Spatial population structure,
as caused for example by geographically limited dispersal,
also increases the chance of convergent evolution.
For example,
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#0000FF;">geographically patchy</span> selection pressures can lead to much higher probability of parallel adaptation than uniform pressures,
since alleles are unable to spread through intervening populations
<cite class="ltx_cite">(Ralph and Coop, <a href="#bib.bib76" title="Convergent evolution during local adaptation to patchy landscapes" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.
In <cite class="ltx_cite">Ralph and Coop (<a href="#bib.bib120" title="Parallel adaptation: one or many waves of advance of an advantageous allele?" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> we formulated a simple model of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#0000FF;">convergent adaptation in
a spatially spread population with local dispersal
that is exposed to some novel, spatially homogeneous selection pressure.
We assumed that a single mutational change was sufficient to adapt
the population after the change in environment. Under this assumption,
selected alleles arise and spread locally, as shown in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ The role of standing variation in geographic convergent adaptation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
If the geographic area is large enough multiple selected alleles can
arise independently and spread before any one has spread across all of space.
A somewhat analogous situation also
arises in spatial models of clonal inference in asexuals <cite class="ltx_cite">(Gordo and Campos, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="Adaptive evolution in a spatially structured asexual population" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>; Martens and Hallatschek, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="Interfering waves of adaptation promote spatial mixing" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>; Otwinowski and Krug, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="Clonal interference and Muller’s ratchet in spatial habitats" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p">In this paper, we extend this spatial model to include standing variation
present at mutation-selection balance before the selection pressures switch.
Below,
we show that convergent adaptation within a widespread species is likely to be
common <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#0000FF;">when ranges, population sizes, or mutational targets are large</span>, as has already been seen for a number of traits.
On this basis we argue
that the genetics of adaptation may often be geographically local <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#0000FF;">even
when selection pressures are geographically broad</span>,
and that widespread selective sweeps <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#FF0000;">should tend to occur only</span>
when adaptation is highly constrained (e.g. by small mutation rate or
the need for a linked combination of alleles).

<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#0000FF;">We assume that all alleles of the mutated type are selectively
equivalent (both in terms how deleterious they were before, and how
advantagous they are after, the environmental shift).
Note that these mutations do not have to arise at the same locus,
just that they are selectively equivalent:
these could be mutations arising at the same base pair,
or knockout mutations of any one of a number of genes in a pathway,

(For the purposes of analogy, we could imagine that before time <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS1.SSS0.Px3.p2.m3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="t=0" display="inline"><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>

<p class="ltx_p">If we ignore the effects of new mutation,
then everything about the process is relatively simple:
each point in space will be first reached by the wave whose origination point lies closest to it.
This random tessellation of space is known as a Poisson-Voronoi tessellation <cite class="ltx_cite">(Møller, <a href="#bib.bib45" title="Lectures on random voronoi tessellations" class="ltx_ref">1994</a>)</cite>
(i.e. the cells formed by assigning regions of space to the nearest point in a Poisson process).
The properties of this tessellation by alleles is
determined by the spatial locations of the initiation points,
which are sampled from a spatially homogeneous Poisson process,
independent of the rate of spatial spread.
Introducing new mutations cause some qualitative changes
beyond dependence on new parameters:
the cells formed by a Voronoi tessellation have straight sides,
but the introduction of new mutations cause these to curve
<cite class="ltx_cite">(because the radii of the colliding circles differ; see Figure 1 of  Ralph and Coop, <a href="#bib.bib120" title="Parallel adaptation: one or many waves of advance of an advantageous allele?" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>,  for a graphical depiction of this point)</cite>.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Over roughly the past ten thousand years, alleles conferring resistance to malaria have arisen in a number of genes

A number of these alleles appear to be examples of convergent adaptation,
as different derived mutations in the same gene are seen in different individuals.
For example,
a number of changes that confer malaria resistance have been observed in the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS2.p2.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\beta" display="inline"><mi>β</mi></math>-globin gene;

Another particularly impressive case of convergent evolution <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#FF0000;">is presented by</span> the numerous changes throughout the X-linked G6PD gene,

Whether these all confer resistance to malaria is unknown,
but malaria is thought to be the primary driver of these polymorphisms
<cite class="ltx_cite">(see Hedrick, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="Population genetics of malaria resistance in humans." class="ltx_ref">2011</a>,  for a general review)</cite>.
Three G6PD deficiency alleles are particularly common and relatively well studied:

the Med allele found in the Mediterranean and Middle East;
and the Mahidol allele found Myanmar and Thailand.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#FF0000;">
The protective effects of these G6PD alleles are complicated, and are likely heterogeneous

<p class="ltx_p">Given <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#FF0000;">such strong selection the alleles</span> should have risen
quickly to fixation, so their presence at intermediate frequency,
over a broad geographic area, makes it a good candidate for a recently
balanced polymorphism due to heterozygote advantage <cite class="ltx_cite">(note that
the conditions for a balanced polymorphism are
complicated by the hemizygosity of males, see Hedrick, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="Population genetics of malaria resistance in humans." class="ltx_ref">2011</a>; Pamillo, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="Genic variation at sex-linked loci: quantification of regular selection models" class="ltx_ref">1979</a>)</cite>.
Indeed, hemizygous males and homozygous females suffer from G6PD deficiency,
and homozygote females may also not be protected against malaria <cite class="ltx_cite">(Manjurano<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="African glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase alleles associated with protection from severe malaria in heterozygous females in Tanzania" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="Reappraisal of known malaria resistance loci in a large multicenter study" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.
The theory we use regarding the “wave of advance” <cite class="ltx_cite">(Fisher, <a href="#bib.bib177" title="The wave of advance of advantageous genes" class="ltx_ref">1937</a>)</cite>
applies as well in the case of heterozygote advantage
<cite class="ltx_cite">(Aronson and Weinberger, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="Nonlinear diffusion in population genetics, combustion, and nerve pulse propagation" class="ltx_ref">1975</a>)</cite>, with the selected allele spreading
locally to the equilibrium frequency (rather than fixation).
Therefore, our framework is applicable to the spread of G6PD, with speed determined by the advantage of heterozygotes when rare.
We assume that before malaria became prevalent,
G6PD deficiency alleles suffered a decrease in relative fitness of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS2.p3.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="s_{d}" display="inline"><msub><mi>s</mi><mi>d</mi></msub></math> in heterozygote and homozygotes females and hemizygote males.
Assuming that the underlying causes and strength of this drop in fitness have not changed,
we estimate that <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS2.p3.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="s_{d}" display="inline"><msub><mi>s</mi><mi>d</mi></msub></math> has to have been upward of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS2.p3.m3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim 0.05" display="inline"><mrow><mi></mi><mo>∼</mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow></math> (if <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS2.p3.m4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="s_{b}\geq 0.05" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>s</mi><mi>b</mi></msub><mo>≥</mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow></math>),

The dispersal and demographic parameters of humans in the past few thousand years is unclear,
particularly as we are concerned with the “effective” population density

We therefore will use two reasonable values for the effective population density: <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS2.p4.m6" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\rho=2" display="inline"><mrow><mi>ρ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></math> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS2.p4.m7" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.2" display="inline"><mn>0.2</mn></math> people per km<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS2.p4.m8" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{}^{2}" display="inline"><msup><mi></mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math>,

Clearly, human migration has been shaped both by local dispersal and larger-scale expansions

we defined a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">characteristic length</span> which gave the spatial scale across which mutants with distinct origins would establish.
This was proportional to the mean distance between neighboring established mutants,

These curves match our intuition that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#0000FF;">higher</span> population densities result in
smaller characteristic lengths (as would higher mutation rates).
Allowing standing variation increases <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#0000FF;">the

Higher dispersal distances lead to larger characteristic lengths,
since more rapid geographic spread block other mutations from establishing.

<p class="ltx_p">Another problem that we can address with this work is
the extent to which pleiotropy biases
adaptation towards the repeated use of particular subset of loci
(i.e. convergence at genetic level).
While many alleles may confer the beneficial phenotype,
not all will contribute equally to adaptation if they have negative pleiotropic consequences.
There are at least two ways that negative pleiotropy can contribute to high rates of convergence
when adapting if a single change is sufficient for adaptation.
First, negative pleiotropic effects can reduce
the overall beneficial selection coefficient of an allele in the new environment,
making them unlikely to become established and slow to spread
(and in the worst case making them deleterious).
This first effect has been well studied by a number of authors
<cite class="ltx_cite">(Orr, <a href="#bib.bib36" title="Adaptation and the cost of complexity" class="ltx_ref">2000</a>; Otto, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="Two steps forward, one step back: the pleiotropic effects of favoured alleles" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>; Welch and Waxman, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="Modularity and the cost of complexity" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>; Chevin<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="Fisher’s model and the genomics of adaptation: restricted pleiotropy, heterogenous mutation, and parallel evolution" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> and its role in genetic
convergence examined <cite class="ltx_cite">(Orr, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="The probability of parallel evolution" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>; Chevin<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="Fisher’s model and the genomics of adaptation: restricted pleiotropy, heterogenous mutation, and parallel evolution" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>; Unckless and Orr, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities and adaptation to a shared environment" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite>.
A second contribution is that alleles that have
less negative pleiotropy are more likely to be present as standing variation
before the environmental shift, and so are more able to respond
immediately.</p>

These then could be used in equation (<a href="#S1.E14" title="(14) ‣ 1.6 Multiple variant types ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ The role of standing variation in geographic convergent adaptation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">14</span></a>).
For instance, we could extend the two class model above
so that class one has the additional advantage of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS6.p4.m5" class="ltx_Math" alttext="s_{1,b}&gt;s_{2,b}" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>s</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow></msub><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>.
This would further increase the contribution of the rarer class,
because this class would both overcome drift more often and spread more rapidly.
However, a straightforward application of the logic of used to construct equation (<a href="#S1.E14" title="(14) ‣ 1.6 Multiple variant types ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ The role of standing variation in geographic convergent adaptation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">14</span></a>)
fails once the different allelic types meet,
since the assumption of selective exclusion no longer holds:
alleles with higher <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS6.p4.m6" class="ltx_Math" alttext="s_{b}" display="inline"><msub><mi>s</mi><mi>b</mi></msub></math> will spread, at a lower speed, into regions occupied by alleles with lower <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS6.p4.m7" class="ltx_Math" alttext="s_{b}" display="inline"><msub><mi>s</mi><mi>b</mi></msub></math>.
Given enough time, the most advantageous type (type 1, in this case) would spread everywhere,
and so substituting multiple values for <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS6.p4.m8" class="ltx_Math" alttext="s_{b}" display="inline"><msub><mi>s</mi><mi>b</mi></msub></math> in equation (<a href="#S1.E14" title="(14) ‣ 1.6 Multiple variant types ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ The role of standing variation in geographic convergent adaptation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">14</span></a>)
would only provide a short-term approximation to a longer term dynamic.
Even if the initial tessellation has formed with purely class 2 alleles,
the first allele would have a selective advantage <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS6.p4.m9" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\delta s=s_{b,1}-s_{b,2}" display="inline"><mrow><mrow><mi>δ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>s</mi><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>,</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>,</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math>,
and so would arise at rate <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS6.p4.m10" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2\rho\mu_{1}\delta s" display="inline"><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>ρ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>μ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mi>δ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow></math> and would spread at speed <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS6.p4.m11" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sigma\sqrt{\delta s}" display="inline"><mrow><mi>σ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msqrt><mrow><mi>δ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow></msqrt></mrow></math>.
An extension of our Poisson process model could incorporate these effects,
by thinning the Poisson process of establishing mutations by correctly,
but is considerably less tractable.
Whether allele <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS6.p4.m12" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2" display="inline"><mn>2</mn></math> persists would depend on the linkage arrangements between loci.
If the loci underlying allele 1 and 2 are unlinked, then allele 1 can spread without disrupting allele 2.
However, if they are linked, the spread of allele <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS6.p4.m13" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1" display="inline"><mn>1</mn></math> may push allele <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S1.SS6.p4.m14" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2" display="inline"><mn>2</mn></math> out of the population.

the process is largely unaffected by spatial structure,

among populations may be quite common, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#0000FF;">at least when population
densities and mutational target sizes are not too small, and dispersal is
limited across the range. While considering smaller mutational
target sizes (e.g., less than the 100bp in our example) or lower population densities would lower the probability of convergence
within a given geographical area, it would also act to considerably lengthen
the time to adaptation. In such cases adaptation may simply fail to
occur at all or populations may adapt via some other means (e.g., by using a
broader mutational target).

While at face value this increase seems unsurprising,
this relationship differs markedly from the case of multiple competing
alleles in a panmictic population <cite class="ltx_cite">(see discussion above and in  Hermisson and Pennings, <a href="#bib.bib116" title="Soft sweeps: molecular population genetics of adaptation from standing genetic variation" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>; Pennings and Hermisson, <a href="#bib.bib117" title="Soft sweeps II - molecular population genetics of adaptation from recurrent mutation or migration" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>.
Importantly, allowing standing variation may greatly lower the time until the species becomes adapted
across the geographic range of the selection pressure. We have also
shown that adaptation through standing variation biases the type of variation towards those alleles
with fewer pleiotropic effects, since these are more common as standing variation before the environmental shift.
This bias can in some cases easily overcome quite significant differences in mutational target sizes
among loci allowing the same locus to be repeatedly the source of
adaptation even if there are seemingly many different routes to adaptation.

geographic convergent adaptation occurs means that we should
incorporate it more widely into our thinking about the genetic basis
of adaptation. For example, the absence of European skin pigmentation alleles in
ancient DNA from Europeans who lived several thousand years ago
has led to the suggestion that these individuals had dark
pigmentation <cite class="ltx_cite">(Olalde<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="Derived immune and ancestral pigmentation alleles in a 7,000-year-old mesolithic european" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; Lazaridis<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="Ancient human genomes suggest three ancestral populations for present-day europeans" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; Wilde<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="Direct evidence for positive selection of skin, hair, and eye pigmentation in Europeans during the last 5,000 years" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.

adapted to high latitudes via a different complement of “light-skin” pigmentation alleles;
to our knowledge, we have no strong evidence either way.
Such convergence may considerably complicate the
exploration of phenotypes and adaptation among populations using variants mapped in a

This pattern may be very hard to distinguish from local adaptation using population genomic approaches
alone. This is especially problematic as boundaries between convergent alleles may often
occur where gene flow rates are low, i.e. historical and ecological breaks, even if
the alleles concerned have no bearing on the ecological differences

We are rarely so fortunate as to know as much about the genetics, phenotypic distributions,
and potential selection agents as we do for malaria resistance in humans.
Therefore, we must be wary of mistaking the strange spatial distributions of particular alleles
for adaptation to some very specific selection pressure (e.g. the distribution of the Mahidol allele in Figure <a href="#S1.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 1.2 G6PD example ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ The role of standing variation in geographic convergent adaptation" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>),

Under the parameter regime we study,
standing variants are still quite young,
so we do not expect a strongly reduced hitchhiking effect.
As such, following the initial period of
adaptation, we should expect the population to be partitioned into a
set of geographically restricted long haplotypes.
Given sufficient time these haplotypes will mix together through
migration and drift,
potentially leading to a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#FF0000;">within population</span> signal of a sweep from multiple independent

deleterious before the environment switches. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#FF0000;"> In contrast, if they adapt via common variation even distant populations could have
a shared basis of adaptation, e.g. previously neutral (or nearly neutral) variation, shared among populations.
If many loci contribute to variation in a trait, then
selection on any one allele may be weak,
which might lead adaptation to use the same alleles in different populations.
However, sufficiently differentiated populations may still
adapt via different genetic routes, as the constellation of alleles
that respond to selection quickest will be somewhat different due to
drift among populations</span> <cite class="ltx_cite">(Barton, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="The divergence of a polygenic system subject to stabilizing selection, mutation and drift" class="ltx_ref">1989</a>)</cite>.

genetic basis to adaptation across populations than simple traits.

<p class="ltx_p">Our results touch on an old debate on the evolutionary coherence of species.
Mayr and many others have argued that species are coherent
evolutionary units because they are united by shared gene flow <cite class="ltx_cite">(pages 521–522 in Mayr, <a href="#bib.bib68" title="Animal species and evolution" class="ltx_ref">1963</a>)</cite>.
However, this argument has been questioned by a number of authors

Even if gene flow is not high enough to prevent neutral differentiation or local adaptation,
a number of authors have argued that species are cohesive
if gene flow is high enough for globally selected alleles
(and their hitchhiking haplotypes)
to spread across entire species
<cite class="ltx_cite">(see also Rieseberg and Burke, <a href="#bib.bib85" title="The biological reality of species: gene flow, selection, and collective evolution" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>; Morjan and Rieseberg, <a href="#bib.bib100" title="How species evolve collectively: implications of gene flow and selection for the spread of advantageous alleles" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>; Ellstrand, <a href="#bib.bib74" title="Is gene flow the most important evolutionary force in plants?" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.
At present, large scale genotyping and sequencing projects,
along with more sophisticated methods,
are highlighting ever more signals of gene flow between populations and species <cite class="ltx_cite">(Patterson<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="Ancient admixture in human history" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>; Sousa and Hey, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="Understanding the origin of species with genome-scale data: modelling gene flow" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>; Hellenthal<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="A genetic atlas of human admixture history" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.

widespread selection pressures through convergent evolution rather
than waiting for a single allele to migrate across the range.</p>

This is likely in part due to the relatively low incidence of widespread selection pressures,
but as noted above even when we know of widespread selection
pressures (e.g. malaria) the response is usually convergent, not shared, across large spatial scales.
On the other hand,
introgression of adaptive alleles across species and sub-species boundaries,
suggests that selected alleles do sometimes spread despite low
migration rates <cite class="ltx_cite">(see  Hedrick, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="Adaptive introgression in animals: examples and comparison to new mutation and standing variation as sources of adaptive variation" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>,  for a recent review)</cite>.
However, at least some of these cases
may be caused by introgression of haplotype complexes
consisting of many, tightly linked, beneficial alleles (that perhaps
are inaccessible by mutation over reasonable time-scales for a population in a new
environment).
Currently we can only scan genomes for species-wide sweeps
in those few organisms with population-scale sequence data,
and so we do not know if these observations generalize to most species.
This is rapidly changing,
and will allow us to form a much improved picture of the relationship
between the level of neutral population structure,
and the age and geographic spread of selected alleles across many species.

Such drops in range size may fix, or radically change the species-wide frequency,

Furthermore, many modes of speciation are proposed to occur through a
geographically-limited subset of populations forming the basis of new species,
e.g. the splitting off of part of the range through a vicariance event

an allopatric or parapatric view of the biogeography of speciation.
However, it is worth revisiting this idea as geographically broad population genomic
sampling allows us to return to themes

Along similar lines, Futuyma has argued that much of the adaptive differentiation within species,
e.g. adaptation to local conditions,
may be ephemeral and subject to loss due to local extinction and the mixing
following the collapse of population structure <cite class="ltx_cite">(Futuyma, <a href="#bib.bib84" title="Evolutionary constraint and ecological consequences" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>, <a href="#bib.bib82" title="On the role of species in anagenesis" class="ltx_ref">1987</a>)</cite>.
Futuyma offered this as an explanation of the pattern of punctuated equilibrium <cite class="ltx_cite">(Eldredge and Gould, <a href="#bib.bib67" title="Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism" class="ltx_ref">1972</a>)</cite>,
and argued that the observation of stasis and rapid anagenesis associated with speciation
were consistent with micro-evolution.
Futuyma argued that despite rapid adaptation over short time-scales, we
may observe morphological stasis in the fossil record as much of this
adaptation is lost to local extinction and the collapse of population structure
<cite class="ltx_cite">(see also Lieberman and Dudgeon, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="An evaluation of stabilizing selection as a mechanism for stasis" class="ltx_ref">1996</a>; Eldredge<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib81" title="The dynamics of evolutionary stasis" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>; Futuyma, <a href="#bib.bib84" title="Evolutionary constraint and ecological consequences" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>.
Furthermore, he suggests that speciation
may act as ratchet to prevent the loss of differentiation, acting to
maintain adaptive changes among populations, and prevent their loss by interbreeding.
At face value the rate of species formation seems too low to contribute to this process.
However, <cite class="ltx_cite">Rosenblum<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib83" title="Goldilocks Meets Santa Rosalia: An Ephemeral Speciation Model Explains Patterns of Diversification Across Time Scales" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>, and many others,
have argued that the rate of speciation may well be quite high,
but that the majority of incipient species do not persist long due to
reabsorption or extinction.
Changes in range size, due to local extinction, can also be very rapid
on the time-scales over which alleles may spread on the landscape <cite class="ltx_cite">(Gaston, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="The structure and dynamics of geographic ranges" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>; Hewitt, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="Some genetic consequences of ice ages, and their role in divergence and speciation" class="ltx_ref">1996</a>)</cite>.

Neutral substitutions are unaffected by this process,
because they accumulate in a clocklike manner along lineages,
as dictated by the mutation rate,
regardless of the geographic details of their polymorphic stage.
Turning to the accumulation of adaptive substitutions,
it is likely that splits in phylogenies are only a tiny proportion of all incipient speciation events,
because extinction rates may be high <cite class="ltx_cite">(Rosenblum<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib83" title="Goldilocks Meets Santa Rosalia: An Ephemeral Speciation Model Explains Patterns of Diversification Across Time Scales" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>,
and so every lineage has likely passed through many “speciation events” in addition to the observed ones.
Under these assumptions,
spatial polymorphisms could accumulate gradually in geographically restricted populations
between the large-scale biogeographic events that cause their fixation or loss.
This effectively decorrelates the time at which new alleles arise and when they fix in the species,
an effect similar to that pointed out by <cite class="ltx_cite">Gillespie (<a href="#bib.bib56" title="Substitution processes in molecular evolution. II. Exchangeable models from population genetics" class="ltx_ref">1994</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">There is evidence that a reasonable fraction of genome-wide substitutions are fixed by positive selection in a number of species
<cite class="ltx_cite">(most notably Drosophila,  Sella<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="Pervasive natural selection in the Drosophila genome?" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite>.
Under the geographic view of fixation,
selection has played a strong role in the establishment of these alleles locally.
As we get more broadly geographic population genomics sampling for a range of species
we will have the opportunity to study whether the class of alleles that contribute to local differentiation
are similar to those underlying species divergence,
and the extent to which the answer to this depends on the
age and type of population structure within species.</p>

<div id="S2.SS7.SSS0.Px4.p6" class="ltx_para">
        
<p class="ltx_p">Finally, we close by noting that range expansion and speciation
are obviously not separate from adaptive differentiation.
The invasion of new geographic areas may lead to a burst of adaptive differentiation,
at least in a subset of genes, and speciation may be associated with rapidly adaption to novel environments.
Conversely, if the geographic spread of adaptive alleles within ranges is slow
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" style="color:#FF0000;">(e.g. if they only offer a local advantage or if they are selectively excluded)</span>
this may allow Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities to arise within species,
effectively offering a mechanism for hybrid incompatibilities to evolve in parapatry,
and fracturing the range <cite class="ltx_cite">(Bank<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="The limits to parapatric speciation: Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities in a continent-island model" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>; Kondrashov, <a href="#bib.bib99" title="Accumulation of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities within a spatially structured population" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>; Bierne<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="The coupling hypothesis: why genome scans may fail to map local adaptation genes" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>.
The alleles that act as components in many of the Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities studied to date
are geographically restricted <cite class="ltx_cite">(see Cutter, <a href="#bib.bib80" title="The polymorphic prelude to Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>.
Therefore, it seems possible that populations within species may often be tending towards speciation,
and that as outlined here that this may drive some proportion of molecular divergence.</p>
